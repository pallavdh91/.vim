Vim configuration
====

Likely does not support older versions of vim. It is recommended to have the latest `Huge` version, and to set the `TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color`, if your terminal supports [256 colors](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/256_colors_in_vim).

1. Clone the repository
    
        $ git clone git://github.com/pallavdh91/.vim.git ~/.vim

2. Use `setup.sh` for both installation and update, of symlinks and plugins
        
        $ sh ~/.vim/setup.sh
    Additional plugins can listed in the same file, please see the source for more info.
